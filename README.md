# Comparative-analysis-of-SVM-kernells 
Comparative analysis of linear,polynomial, and RBF kernel of Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# DESCRIPTION:
By using the stock dataset predicting the stock price of 30th day using different kernels of SVM

1.reading the date and open price column from training stock dataset

2.fitting the data into different kernels

3.plotting the graph of different kernels

4.analysing the accuracy of different kernels in predicting the stock price by comparing with the test data
